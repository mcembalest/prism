# State Changes & Collaboration Events

## Task: Diagram your repo’s collaboration model

1. **[Editor]** Create a diagram (e.g., in Markdown or a diagram tool) showing commits → PRs → Actions → releases.
2. **[GitHub UI]** Store the diagram in the repo wiki or docs directory.
3. **[Browser]** Review with the team and iterate on collaboration rules.

## Task: Set up CODEOWNERS and a PR lifecycle policy

1. **[Editor]** Add a `CODEOWNERS` file mapping paths to owners (e.g., `@org/team`).
2. **[GitHub UI]** Commit to repo root or `.github/` directory.
3. **[GitHub UI]** Verify PRs touching those paths now require owner reviews.

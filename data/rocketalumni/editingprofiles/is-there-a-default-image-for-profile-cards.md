There is not a default image for profiles when the site is created. If you would like to add one, navigate to the “Images and Videos” tab within the CMS for the folder you would like to have profiles with default images. Then select “Advanced Features”. Here you can drag and drop an image into the “Default Profile Image” slot which will automatically make any profile within that folder use that image as its profile picture (if it does not already have a different profile picture).

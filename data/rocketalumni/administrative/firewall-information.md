If you are having trouble logging into the platform, it may be because your school's network security is blocking the Rocket’s platform.

To get this resolved, it is best to reach out to your internal IT team and request that they place the following domains on a safe/do not block list to ensure you are able to use the platform to the fullest extent:

https://site.rocketalumnisolutions.com

Additionally, to make sure you are receiving all communications from Rocket Alumni Solutions, it is best to whitelist/allow all emails coming from the domains @rocketalumnisolutions.com, and the email support@rocketalumnisolutions.com.

If you or your IT team needs any assistance on this process please feel free to reach out to our team directly - support@rocketalumnisolutions.com.

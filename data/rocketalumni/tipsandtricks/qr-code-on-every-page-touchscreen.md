If you have a touchscreen, placing a QR code on your site is a great way to let people open up your site on their phones. You might already know how to create a QR code button on your homepage. If not, you can read this article on how to customize home buttons. However, if you'd like a QR code that links to your site on every page, other than just the homepage, follow these steps:

Navigate to the main folders page
Click on the Advanced Features section of the gear tab
Toggle Show Footer QR
This will display a QR code on the bottom-right of your site that will open up your site on a phone when scanned. Keep in mind that the QR will only show up on touchscreens!

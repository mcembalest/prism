What is a Cache?
While searching the internet, your website browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge/Explorer) collects bits of information (or code) from the sites you visit and stores them on your device to optimize future page loading speeds.

However, if the cache gets full, your browser's memory becomes overloaded, resulting in some websites taking longer than usual to load or function.

Clearing your cache refreshes browser memory by cutting out those bits of code that were slowing it down.

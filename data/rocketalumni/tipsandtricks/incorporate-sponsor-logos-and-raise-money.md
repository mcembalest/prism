You can use sponsor logos on your site in a variety of ways. Many schools drive revenue by offering sponsorships to businesses, in which their logo appears on the school’s visual content. This is super important now because it can be a great way for schools or athletic departments to drive additional revenue at a time when there are no athletic events occurring. For example schools with equipment deals, they can add the company’s logo to any content they make, a collaboration with a merchandising company, etc.

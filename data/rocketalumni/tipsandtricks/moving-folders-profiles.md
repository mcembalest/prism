Let’s say we want to move the folder “Hall of Fame” into “Destination Folder”. 


We simply:

Open the "Hall of Fame" folder.
Click "Advanced Features" under the Settings & Layout tab.
Select the "Move Folder Location" dropdown menu and choose the destination folder. Note that the destination folder must contain at least one folder, not a profile.

Moving Profiles: 

Open the profile you want to move.
Click "Advanced Features" under the Settings & Layout tab.
Select the "Move Profile Location" dropdown menu and choose the destination folder. Note that the destination folder must contain at least one profile and cannot contain a subfolder.

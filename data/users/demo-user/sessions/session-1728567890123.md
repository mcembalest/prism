**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Duration**: 35 minutes
**Course**: Redis Fundamentals
**Topics Covered**: Basic commands, keyspace fundamentals

## Session Summary

User completed the introductory session on Redis fundamentals. Showed good understanding of basic concepts and demonstrated ability to use Redis CLI effectively.

## Key Interactions

### Initial Context
- User wanted to understand what Redis is and when to use it
- Started with no prior Redis experience but familiar with databases

### Learning Activities
1. Connected to Redis CLI and ran PING command successfully
2. Practiced SET/GET commands with various key patterns
3. Explored key expiration with TTL/EXPIRE
4. Learned about different data types (strings, hashes, lists)

### Questions Asked
- "When should I use Redis vs a traditional database?"
- "How do I check what keys exist in my Redis instance?"
- "What happens if I set a key that already exists?"

### Tutor Responses
- Explained Redis as an in-memory data store best for caching, sessions, real-time data
- Demonstrated KEYS * (with warning about production use) and SCAN
- Showed how SET overwrites existing values, introduced NX/XX flags

## Outcomes

✅ Successfully connected to Redis
✅ Understands basic key-value operations
✅ Can use TTL for key expiration
⏳ Needs more practice with data types beyond strings

## Next Steps

- Deep dive into Redis hashes for structured data
- Practice with Redis lists for queues
- Explore pub/sub for real-time features

## Tutor Notes

User is engaged and asks thoughtful questions. Pace is appropriate. Ready to move to intermediate concepts with hashes and search indexing.
